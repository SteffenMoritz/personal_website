I started to create apps with Shiny almost immediately after having discovered it. This was in May last year and two months later I thought it would be a great idea to build an app to treat more easily World Bank data. Indeed, in my field, World Development Indicators (WDI) are often used and I thought it would be useful to have a graphical interface where we can import and treat these indicators.\nSo in July last year I started to work on this. Besides building something useful, I considered this as a good opportunity to practice with R Shiny. I worked on that irregularly during the rest of the year. Sometimes I considerably improved my app in a week and sometimes I spent two months not thinking about it.\nIn January, I was quite stuck: my app required to generate pieces of UI (User Interface) on the fly and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to do that. But when I saw the announcement for the second edition of the Shiny Contest, I convinced myself to give it a try and worked a lot on my app, especially since I finally understood how to use modules. Therefore, after a few weeks, I could finally deploy my app and participate to the contest. Given the incredible apps of other participants (just look at the \u0026ldquo;Shiny Contest\u0026rdquo; tag on RStudio Community), I know that there is not a chance that I win something but nonetheless I am very proud of having the possibility to show what I can do.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s very good\u0026rdquo;, you may say, \u0026ldquo;but what does your app do?\u0026rdquo;. Well if you are familiar with the WDIs, you know that each indicator has an ID (like \u0026ldquo;NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS\u0026rdquo;). Using this ID in my app, you can import the dataset related, choose the type of data you want (cross-country, time series, panel data), the country/countries and year(s) you want and compute the logarithm, the squared value and the lagged value of the variable. You may also generate a plot that you can download for this dataset. You can import and manipulate as many datasets as you desire and when you are done, you can merge them in a final dataset that is also downloadable. Finally, since reproducibility is a big aspect in science, all the manipulations you did are translated into R code so that you can copy and paste this code in a fresh R session and it will reproduce everything you have done. This was made possible thanks the great (but still experimental) shinymeta package^[Luckily, I have discovered this package a month before I launched my app, in a rstudio::conf 2020 presentation by Carson Sievert].\nYou can try the app here, but if it has been removed by the time you go checking it, you may find the source code for the whole app on GitHub.\n","date":1586304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586304000,"objectID":"27557541981e1449626d4a3d62ada71b","permalink":"/blog/my-app-for-shiny-contest-2020/","publishdate":"2020-04-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/my-app-for-shiny-contest-2020/","section":"blog","summary":"One of the greatest things about R is the possibility to build websites quite easily with R Shiny.

I have learnt a few very useful shortcuts by reading blog posts or free R books here and there and I have decided to make a small list of those I use most.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+Enter\u0026rdquo;: run the whole script This combination will run all of your script, wherever the mouse is in the script. This considerably saves some time and is much more convenient than having to drag the mouse up to the \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo; button.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+F10\u0026rdquo;: restart R session Almost all your work will have to be done again one day, either by you or by somebody else. That day, you will regret not having saved all the packages you needed in your R script. How is that possible? Well, it comes from the fact that I (and presumably other people too) load some packages and their dependencies in the same session because we test some packages, or because we are trying to solve a StackOverflow problem during a break, etc. Therefore, when you were writing it, some of your code was running only thanks to some packages you didn\u0026rsquo;t keep in your script.\nTo prevent this to happen again, you can run \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+F10\u0026rdquo; sometimes: it restarts the R session (but does not close RStudio) and allows to see quickly if your code can run all by itself. When I have finished writing a chunk of code, I always do \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+F10\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+Enter\u0026rdquo; to make sure that my code can run again in three months or more.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+K\u0026rdquo;: knit Markdown documents I do not use this everywhere but only in Markdown documents: it knits the document. As \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+Enter\u0026rdquo; replaces the \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo; button, \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+K\u0026rdquo; replaces the \u0026ldquo;Knit\u0026rdquo; button.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Alt+B\u0026rdquo;: run the script from the beginning to where I am This is similar to \u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+Enter\u0026rdquo; but it runs the script only until your mouse.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+A\u0026rdquo;: good alignment Indentation is quite important to have a code that is readable, especially when you begin to write more than 10 lines of code. Select your code (or just a piece of it) and do this combination to apply indentation rules automatically.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+R\u0026rdquo;: new section label This creates a new section in your code, with the title you choose. Quite convenient to keep a readable code.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+N\u0026rdquo;: new file If you want to try a chunk of code quickly, you can run this combination to open a new file in RStudio.\n\u0026ldquo;Ctrl+Shift+C\u0026rdquo;: comment and un-comment lines of code To me, this is one of the most convenient shortcut. It simply allows to comment (and un-comment) at once all the lines selected.\nThe complete list of shortcuts is available in \u0026ldquo;Tools -\u0026gt; Keyboard Shortcuts Help\u0026rdquo; in RStudio.
